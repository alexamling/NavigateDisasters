Person 1:  We thought we were safe, but the water just kept rising!  
Person 2: Thank you so much! We had no idea we were gonna get hit this hard.
Dispatcher: Great. Now, take them to another lily pad. 
Dispatcher: I’ve identified five potential drop-off locations, but it’s hard to tell which ones have are the most elevated, accessible, and have the most resources. 
Dispatcher: You can see all of the locations on your map, represented by lily pads.
Dispatcher: Once you’ve made your choice and navigate to the lily pad, let me know so I can give you another task.
