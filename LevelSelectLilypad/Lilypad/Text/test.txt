Just kidding. The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult 
as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly 
but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A single lap should be completed every time you hear 
this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete 
a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's 
a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence 
the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared 
about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so 
powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately,
he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save others 
from death, but not himself.
