Thanks for the purchase the money you spent it will be reuse to keep on working on new asset and new contentd
To try the game complete ONLY ONE MISSION AT TIME.
Guide:
The logic s simple before the game start ,the system prepare your mission,you can have max 3 question active each time
There are 4 different kind of mission.
-Coins mission called Midas
-Highscore
-Frugal test(you don't have to collect anything)
-Time mission(finish the level in a certain ammount of time)
After this four mission there will be a white screen you can add every mission you want
You can find a full explanation in my codes
The package is made up of 9 scripts:
After Level:When the level ends a new scene starts where you can check which mission you have accomplished and which doesnt
Frugal Test:check if coins are collected are 0 or objects collected are 0
Game:it is very important it keeps track of your progress in the game
Highscore:check if you have a new high score or not 
Midas Test:check if you have collected the desire number of coins to accomplish your mission
SpeedRunTest:have you accomplished the game in the right time?
Test Start :you can enter in mission world 
Mission:collect any kind of information about your mission 
Mission Handler:we can say it is the heart of the projct if you want modify something like the number of current mission ,the max number of mission that is the right
place.You are free to customize the package for your own game
Remember to respect the same name of canvas component ,my scripts work with reference to the name so remember if you want to change the name change also the script

How it works?
It works in a simple way when you press play the test starts you have to press A.
In game scene you can add coins or complete mission status by clicking on the desire button H for example if you want a new best score
Remember to complete one mission at time to see what you can do
There are 3 colors of mission:
Green:Mission complete
Red: Mission uncomplete
Grey:New mission
You can change the color in mission handler script

How to modify:
You can add many mission as you want for example if you want to add mission about coins you just need to create 
a new script call it Midas Test1 for example:
 return PlayerPrefs.GetInt("gold") >= 20;
to    
return PlayerPrefs.GetInt("gold") >= 30; 
and so on you have to make them child of mission game object and add a mission script with midas test 1
You can change also the color if you don't like the pre selected color used for button on mission handler gameobject

Expand:
This package could be an interesting element to avoid waste of time by scripting on a very complex system which you can find in many games like banana kong temple run advenure time ski safari and so on
